# 🌸 FRQ Questions !? 🎀

## 💖 About This Question...
The first FRQ consisted of several different things math.random(), for loops, and if statements for the most part! Fun fact: Before the AP exam, like 3 hours before it, I wrote the math.random() on the board without thinking much about it. 
Suddenly it was in the exam !? I'm just a psychic for these FRQs tbh!! Here's more info:

- **Question Topic:** [math.random()]
- **Difficulty Level:** [Easy]
- **Rate This Question?:** [9]

## 🛍️ Struggles with This Question...
Another fun fact is I forgot how to use math.random() during the previous mock exam... so perfect chance to redeem myself !!

- **Challenge 1:** [Calling other methods, it nearly slipped out of my head somehow.]
- **Challenge 2:** [I called 1-49 rather than 1-50 for the second portion of the question.]
- **What I'm Doing:** [I can't EXACTLY retake the exam however I can always make sure to remember to +1 most pieces of code when randoming and going over method calling + creation. ]

## 🌷 Prior Experiences That Helped...
We all have those magical moments where everything just clicks! ✨ Here's how my past helped: 

- **Support 1:** The poster project was my def best friend here! Not the right question but someone had a random (I think) and it helped a lot!
- **Support 2:** Mock Exam, seriously, I'd never remember how badly I needed to review random without it. Humbling momment.
- **Support 3:** Albert, albert, albert. Seriously, the amount of randoms on there is insane. They know what they're doing.
